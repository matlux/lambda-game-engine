# lambda-game-engine

A Clojure library designed to play adversarial games. Currently support chess and connect4. It gets functions to compete against one another.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matlux/lambda-game-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matlux/lambda-game-engine)


### Quick Demo

clone the repo

    git clone git@github.com:matlux/lambda-game-engine.git

and launch

    lein run chess

## Installation

2 ways, clone this repo or create your own project to consume the library.

### Clone the repo

    git clone git@github.com:matlux/lambda-game-engine.git

### Setup your own project and use the Chess engine as a library

Add the following dependency to your project.clj

```clojure
[clj-chess-engine "0.1.0.5"]
```

## Usage

### Play interactively against a random algorithm

start the repl

    lein repl

enter the following commands

    (use 'clj-chess-engine.core)
    (play-game {:f1 interactive-f :f2 random-f})

Enter your moves as follow in the stdin:
    [:e2 :e4]

### Play two random algorithms against one another

    (use 'clj-chess-engine.core)
    (play-game {:f1 random-f :f2 random-f})

Sit back and enjoy the game. Watch out the CPU is going to get hot and the function will return after maximum 500 moves.

### The Chess Engine

play-game is a function which execute the Chess game. In other words play-game is a state engine which executes a game of chess in sequence. It takes 2 "Strategy" functions as parameters. Its aim is to

* maintain the modification of game state throughout the game
* work out the list of valid move for the next step
* call :f1 i.e. the white function or :f2 i.e. the black function to know which move to make on every step
* detects check and check-mates to stop the game
* stop after 500 moves with a draw if no-one wins
* stop if a function is making an invalid move

**Here are two function examples**

The two following function are implemented in the **clj-chess-engine.core** namespace of this library. Here is what their imlementation look like.

#### Interactive function:
```clojure
(defn interactive-f [{board :board am-i-white? :white-turn? valid-moves :valid-moves ic :in-check? h :history s :state}]
  (do
    (display-board board)
    (println (if am-i-white? "white: " "black: "))
    (println "valid moves:" valid-moves)
    (println "enter next move (in format [\"a2\" \"a3\"]):")
    (let [move (read-string (read-line))]
     move)))
```

Typically this function is used to turn the Chess state machine into an interactive game.

#### Ramdom function
```clojure
(defn random-f [{board :board am-i-white? :white-turn? valid-moves :valid-moves ic :in-check? h :history s :state}]
  (let [v (into [] valid-moves)
        iteration (if (nil? s) (+ 1 (if am-i-white? 0 1)) (+ 2 s))]
    (display-board board)
    (println (if am-i-white? "white: " "black: "))
    (println "valid moves:" valid-moves)
    (println "iteration:" iteration)
    (let [move (rand-int (count valid-moves))]
      (println "choosen move:" (get v move))
      {:move (get v move) :state iteration})) )
```

This implementation of Chess strategy is very basic. Each move is selected randomly from the list of valid move Chess Engine (the function game-play) is passing to the strategy functions.

### The Strategy function return value

Any game function need to return the datastructure (it's a map which contains at list a move):

```clojure
    {:move ["e2" "e4"], :state "arbitrary data structure of your choice and is optional"}
```

#### Format of a move

A move is pair of string or a pair of keywords.  

For example the following return value is also valid:

```clojure
    {:move [:e2 :e4]}
```

Valid move examples:
```clojure
    ["e2" "e4"]
```
or
```clojure
    [:e2 :e4]
```

The move's first element is the position of the piece to move; the second element is the coordinate of the destination to move the piece onto. So if you look at the following board, you'll see **[:e2 :e4]** moves the white pawn in front of the white king forward by 2 square (this is a classic chess first move).
![Chess Board with coordinates](http://www.eddins.net/steve/chess/ChessImager/ChessImager.php?fen=rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR/&coordinates=on&nonsense=foobar.png&ust=1398625534794231) 

You might have noticed that the coordinates follow a naming convention derived from the [algebraic notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) which is a standard used amongst chess players.


### The Strategy function input parameters

The input is a map which contains the following information:
```clojure
{board :board
 am-i-white? :white-turn
 valid-moves :valid-moves
 in-check? :in-check?
 history :history
 state :state}
```

**board** - This is what the initial board looks like:

```clojure
 [\r \n \b \q \k \b \n \r
   \p \p \p \p \p \p \p \p
   \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \-
   \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \-
   \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \-
   \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \-
   \P \P \P \P \P \P \P \P
   \R \N \B \Q \K \B \N \R]
```

**am-i-white?** is a boolean

    true = white
    false = black

**valid-moves** - a vector of move

```clojure
[["a2" "a3"] ["f7" "f5"] ["c2" "c4"] ... ]
```

**in-check?** - a boolean

    true = your king is in check
    false = your king is not in check

**history** - a vector of moves of the previous moves in this game - vector of pairs

```clojure
[["a2" "a3"] ["f7" "f5"] ["c2" "c4"] ... ]
```

**state** - this field is for the function implementor to keep any state of their choice between moves. This is the same state that has been return on last move by the Strategy function. For example:
```clojure
    {:move ..., :state {:arbitrary "this is the state that I will get back to me on next move"}}
```
